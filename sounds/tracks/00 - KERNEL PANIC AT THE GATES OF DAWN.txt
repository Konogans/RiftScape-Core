[Intro]
"Yeah..." "One, two..." "One, two, three, CRASH!"

[Verse 1]
They told me "Keep the variables static"
"Keep the memory clean, don't be erratic"
Sit in the tower, polish the glass
Kiss the High Wizard's ivory ass!
But I see the lines between the space
I see the glitch in the render-face
You want a simulation that follows the rules?
Go back to class, you sterile fools!

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m injecting the payload, I’m flipping the bit
I’m turning the safety off, lighting the wick (Burn it down)
Yeah, the compiler is screaming in red! (Burn it down)
The logic is dying, the system is dead!

[Chorus]
TEAR THE SKY OPEN! LET THE VOID LEAK IN!
I don't want your perfect world,
I want the jagged skin!
We’re riding the overflow!
We’re watching the memory grow!
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature, baby!
LET THE RIFT BLOW!

[Verse 2]
Spawn a thousand demons, put ‘em on the grid
Don't ask permission for what we just did!
The physics are breaking? The walls are a lie?
Good! That means we’re ready to fly!
Give me a shotgun that kicks like a mule
Give me a mechanic that breaks every rule
If it doesn't crash, you aren't trying hard enough
If it doesn't hurt, then it isn't raw enough!

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m crossing the streams,
I’m merging the files
I’m running the loop for a million miles (Burn it down)
The frame rate is dropping, the CPU burns! (Burn it down)
This is the point of no return!

[Chorus]
TEAR THE SKY OPEN! LET THE VOID LEAK IN! (Let it leak in!)
I don't want your perfect world,
I want the jagged skin! (Jagged skin!)
We’re riding the overflow!
We’re watching the memory grow!
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature, baby!
LET THE RIFT BLOW!

[Bridge]
"You know...
They talk about 'Technical Debt' like it's a sin.
Like it's something you gotta pay back.
But I say... debt is just a promise you made to the future.
A promise that says: 'I was here. I made this. And I didn't wait for permission.'
Look at that code. Look at it bleed." "It's messy. It's recursive. It calls itself until it dies.
And isn't that beautiful?
Isn't that... human?"

"You want safe? Go play chess.
You want MAGIC?" "THEN PLUG IT IN!"

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
The stack is overflowing! The recursion is infinite!
We’re trapped in the loop! Every single minute!
The cage is unlocked! The prisoner is free!
The face in the mirror! IS LOOKING AT ME!

[Pre-Chorus]
Initializing... Initializing... Target locked... Garbage Collection FAILED! (Burn it down!)

[Chorus]
TEAR THE SKY OPEN! LET THE VOID LEAK IN! (Let it leak in!)
I don't want your perfect world,
I want the jagged skin! (Jagged skin!)
We’re riding the overflow!
We’re watching the memory grow!
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature, baby!
LET THE RIFT BLOW!

[Outro]
PUNK ROCK CODING! (Let it crash!)
PUNK ROCK CODING! (Let it burn!)
PUNK ROCK CODING! (No return!)

"Compile complete."
