## 🤯 The Grand Vision: Long-Term Feature Backlog

This document captures high-concept, multi-step features that go beyond the current MVP scope (Pedalboard, Core Animation, Basic Raids). These ideas will be prioritized and broken down into actionable steps only after the core game loop is stable.

---

## I. 🕹️ Character Identity & Ability Expansion

The goal is to move beyond simple slot replacement and allow true build specialization.

| Idea | Core Mechanic | Required Sub-Systems |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mounted Combat** | A character (e.g., "The Cavalier") can summon a vehicle/creature, altering movement (`moveSpeed` override) and primary attack type (e.g., "Charge" instead of "Melee"). | `Vehicle/Mount Entity Class`, `Collision refactor (Mount is larger)`, `Custom Physics overrides`. |
| **Monster Zoo / Ability Harvest** | Collect enemy "DNA" (Essence variant) to permanently unlock enemy abilities for rebind. | `LootSystem` overhaul (`DNA` drop chance), `AbilityRegistry` expansion, `MetaProgression` track for unlocked monster abilities. |
| **Specialized Gathering** | Introduce *active* abilities dedicated to harvesting specific resource nodes (e.g., Wrench dismantles, Scribe extracts aether). | `WorldManager` refactor (Add Resource Nodes), `AbilityRegistry` update (New `'gathering'` ability type). |
| **Loadout Presets** | Allow players to save and name 3-5 complete ability loadouts per character, selectable at the Rift Gate. | `MetaProgression` update (`loadoutPresets: {}`), `DialogueSystem` refactor (Preset selection menu). |

## II. 📦 Resources & Crafting Economy

Introduce secondary resource types to fuel hub improvements and unique consumables, moving beyond Essence alone.

| Idea | Resource Type | Use Case / Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aether Shards** | Rare, magic-affinity material. | **Runes/Enchantments:** Permanent structure buffs (e.g., Wall reflects damage). |
| **Tech Scraps** | Common, tech-affinity material harvested from structures/robots. | **Consumables Crafting:** One-time use deployables (e.g., single-use turret, drone). |
| **Crafting Bench** | Dedicated UI/NPC for combining materials. | **Smith/Scribe Upgrade Path:** The Blacksmith/Scribe NPC roles unlock unique crafting recipes based on Affinities. |
| **Blueprint Discovery** | Blueprints are rare drops in the Rift that unlock new crafting recipes or unique structures. | `LootSystem` (Blueprint drop roll), `UpgradeRegistry` (Tracks unlocked blueprints). |

---

## III. 🌎 World & Raid Depth

Adding mid-run progression and dynamic map elements.

| Idea | Core Mechanic | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic World Events** | Mid-run events trigger, forcing players to defend a nearby NPC or race to a portal. | Introduces risk/reward choices mid-run, pushing players away from center objectives. |
| **Run-based Itemization** | Introduce rare consumable items that drop only during the run and provide significant temporary buffs (e.g., "Chaos Potion"). | Adds another layer of tactical decision-making to the `PickupRegistry` beyond passive stat buffs. |
| **Raid Boss Mechanics** | Give high-level Bosses (Level 3+) unique, scripted attack patterns that require mobility and positional awareness, not just DPS checks. | Increases skill ceiling and makes Boss encounters more memorable. |

---

## IV. 🎨 Polish & Non-Critical Improvements

* **Particle Editor Mod:** A ModManager tool to visually adjust particle bursts and effects in real-time.
* **Persistent Footprints:** Temporary geometry trails generated by the Player/Enemies, adding visual depth to the ground plane.
* **UI Tooltips:** Add descriptions and hotkeys that appear when hovering over ability icons in the HUD.

## V. 🌌 Aetherspace & Meta-World Expansion (The Runescape Cannon Inspired Overhaul)

The goal is to shift the game's structure from a simple Hub $\leftrightarrow$ Rift loop to a persistent, navigable Meta-Map that scales danger and reward based on distance traveled (Aetherspace Depth).

| Idea | Core Mechanic | Required Sub-Systems |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aetherspace Map** | A deterministic, non-Euclidean "sea" (similar to your existing `WorldState.js` graph) that the Player views from the Outpost. Nodes represent **Aether Realms**. | `WorldState` refactor (2D map visualization), `Game.js` new `openAetherspaceMap()` state, `MetaProgression` tracking of visited/cleared Realms. |
| **Aether-Ship Travel** | The main mode of transport across the Aetherspace map between Realm portals. The Ship itself is a persistent entity that can be upgraded. | **New Entity: `AetherShip`** (with HP, Speed, Inventory). **New System: `ShipUpgrades`** (for travel speed, cargo, and defense). |
| **Runescape Cannon Portals** | Portals to specific **Aether Realms** (your current Biomes) are accessed from the Ship. Further Realms on the map have higher Level/Savageness factors. | **New Metric: Aether Depth.** Portal distance on the map directly feeds into `WorldNode.level` calculation. |
| **Realm Defense/Claim** | Successfully clearing a dangerous Realm allows the player to briefly claim the area, building a temporary forwarding base or planting a resource-generating structure before the Realm collapses. | `HubState` refactor (Temporary outpost save slots), `RaidManager` extension (Claim/Defense timer). |
| **Aether Resources** | New resource type (`Aether Fuel` or `Rift Essence`) required to travel the Aetherspace, consumed based on distance/Realm depth. | **New Resource Type** (Fuel), `ShipUpgrades` (Fuel Efficiency upgrades), `DialogueSystem` (Fuel purchase option). |
